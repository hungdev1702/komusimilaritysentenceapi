Api for check similarity of sentences on komu dashboard project:


--- Solution:
Using conponentL: BERD model of Sentence Transformer library
Then transformer a sentence to vector type
Embedding this vector by model BERD 
Using Calculate Cosine Similarity to get ouput
=> Ouput is list % similiraty of 1 sentences today daily with sentences corresponding want to compare with today daily.   


--- Run code project in Local:
Python 3.10.7 <The latest version is preferred>
IDE: Pycharm or VS code

    *note:  input: List<string> , output: list double % of similarity
            default list[0] is daily today sentence is compared
            range(1, len(list)) is list sentences to compare with list[0] - daily today

    Input List<string> with list[0] is daily today is string to compare with other in lists:
